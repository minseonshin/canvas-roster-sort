# canvas-roster-sort
This is a (admittedly janky) Tampermonkey script to sort canvas roster ("People" page) by the "Last Activity" column. It was inspired by https://github.com/jamesjonesmath/canvancement. You should modify it as appropriate (e.g. changing all instances of "uw" to your institution name, etc).
